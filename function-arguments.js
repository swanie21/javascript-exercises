console.log(math(53, 61, 67));

// Challenge:
// In that file, define a function named math that takes three arguments.
// It's important for you to understand that arguments names are only used to
// reference them.
// Name each argument as you like.
// Within the math function, return the value obtained from multiplying the
// second and third arguments and adding that result to the first argument.
// After that, inside the parentheses of console.log(), call the math()
// function with the number 53 as first argument, the number 61 as second and
// the number 67 as third argument.
