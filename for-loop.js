// Challenge:
// In that file define a variable named total and make it equal the number 0.
// Define a second variable named limit and make it equal the number 10.
// Create a for loop with a variable i starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each
// time through the loop. The loop should run as long as i is less than
// limit.
// On each iteration of the loop, add the number i to the total variable. To
// do this, you can use this statement:
//    total += i;
// After the for loop, use console.log() to print the total variable to the
// terminal.
