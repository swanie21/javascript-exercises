var roundUp = 1.5;

var rounded = Math.round(roundUp);

console.log(rounded);

// Challenge:
// In that file define a variable named roundUp that references the float
// 1.5. (decimals are known as floats)
// We will use the Math.round() method to round the number up. This method
// rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.
// An example of using Math.round():
//   Math.round(0.5);
// Define a second variable named rounded that references the output of the
// Math.round() method, passing in the roundUp variable as the argument.
// Use console.log() to print that number to the terminal.
